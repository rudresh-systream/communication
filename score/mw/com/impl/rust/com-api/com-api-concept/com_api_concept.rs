//! This crate defines the concepts and traits of the COM API. It does not provide any concrete
//! implementations. It is meant to be used as a common interface for different implementations
//! of the COM API, e.g., for different IPC backends.
//!
//! # API Design principles
//!
//! - We stick to the builder pattern down to a single service
//!   (TODO: Should this be introduced to the C++ API?)
//! - We make all elements mockable. This means we provide traits for the building blocks.
//!   We strive for enabling trait objects for mockable entities.
//!   (TODO: Inspect all consuming methods for adherence to this rule)
//! - We allow for the allocation of heap memory during initialization phase (offer, connect, ...)
//!   but prevent heap memory usage during the running phase. Any heap memory allocations during the
//!   run phase must happen on preallocated memory chunks.
//! - We support data provision on potentially uninitialized memory for efficiency reasons.
//! - We want to be type safe by deriving as much type information as possible from the interface
//!   description.
//! - We want to design interfaces such that they're hard to misuse.
//! - Data communicated over IPC need to be position independent.
//! - Data may not reference other data outside its provenance.
//! - We provide simple defaults for customization points.
//! - Sending / receiving / calling is always done explicitly.
//! - COM API does not enforce the necessity for internal threads or executors.
//!
//! # Lower layer implementation principles
//!
//! - We add safety nets to detect ABI incompatibilities
//!
//! # Supported IPC ABI
//!
//! - Primitives
//! - Static lists / strings
//! - Dynamic lists / strings
//! - Key-value
//! - Structures
//! - Tuples

    // The `Future` cannot have a `'static` lifetime. If we enforced `'static`, then `self` would
