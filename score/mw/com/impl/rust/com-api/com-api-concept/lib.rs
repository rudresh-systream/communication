/// This is main library file for the com-api-concept crate, which defines the core traits, types,
/// and macros for the communication API concept.
/// It re-exports the main components of the crate, including the interface macro and the Reloc
/// type, which is used for safe data relocation in the communication API.
/// The interface macro generates the necessary types and trait implementations for defining
/// communication interfaces,
/// while the Reloc type provides a safe abstraction for moving data across thread or process
/// boundaries without violating Rust's ownership rules.
