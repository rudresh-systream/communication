//! This file implements the consumer side of the COM API for LoLa runtime.
//! It provides the necessary structures and traits to create consumers
//! that can subscribe to events and receive data samples.
//! It uses FFI to interact with the underlying C++ implementation.
//! Main components include `LolaConsumerInfo`, `SubscribableImpl`,
//! `SubscriberImpl`, `SampleConsumerDiscovery`, and `SampleConsumerBuilder`.
//! These components work together to enable consumers to discover services,
//! subscribe to events, and receive data samples in a type-safe manner.
//! The implementation ensures proper memory management and resource handling
//! through Rust's ownership model and FFI safety practices.

//lifetime warning for all the Sample struct impl block, it is required for the Sample struct
// event lifetime parameter
// and mentaining lifetime of instances and data reference
// As of supressing clippy::needless_lifetimes
//TODO: revist this once com-api is stable - Ticket-234827
