/**
 * \brief Runtime/entry point to our ara::com implementation.
 *
 * This is a singleton class, which cares for initialization of the entire ara::com subsystem.
 * Initialization is done based on configuration files (manifests), which have been handed over via cmdline to
 * the application.
 *
 * AUTOSAR AP currently does <b>not</b> demand the existence of a Runtime class or singleton, but already hints on it
 * being a maybe future extension. (SWS Communication Management 20-11 chapter 7.1.2 Design decisions).
 *
 * It only demands a static method/func within namespace score::mw::com::runtime
 *
 * \details The singleton implementation is based on a Meyers singleton, which gets returned by getInstanceInternal().
 *          This singleton instance needs to get initialized with a Configuration object.
 *          The various overloads of static Initialize() functions differ regarding where/how the configuration is
 *          loaded/provided. All those Initialize() overloads effectively set the static member initialization_config_,
 *          which then gets finally moved into the Meyers singleton instance in the call to getInstanceInternal().
 *          The public getInstance() Method has two functionalities:
 *          - decide, whether the real Runtime singleton (our Meyers singleton) shall be returned or a mock, if one was
 *            injected.
 *          - if it decides to return the real Runtime singleton via getInstanceInternal(), it checks first if already a
 *            valid configuration has been set/loaded via one of the Initialize() overloads and if not, tries to load
 *            if from default path, before it delegates to getInstanceInternal().
