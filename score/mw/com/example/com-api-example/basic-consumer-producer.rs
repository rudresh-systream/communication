// This demo app writing and reading tire pressure data using producer and consumer respectively.
// It is demonstrating the composition of consumer and producer in one struct,
// but they can be used separately as well.
// The example is using Lola runtime, but it can be used with any runtime by changing the runtime initialization part.
// Note: The example is using unwrap and panic in some places for simplicity,
// but it is recommended to handle errors properly in production code.
